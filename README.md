Sequence dice game is increasing in popularity due to its intriguing and entertaining nature. However, no research has been conducted to determine the average expected time to win the game. This study investigated the expected length of the sequence dice game. We used the coupon collector model for unequal probabilities to theoretically simplify the playing board to a one-dimensional board and analysed the expected time it would take to win the game with a restricted set of rules. Empirically, we explored the expected time it would take to win the game with a one-dimensional board when the rules are followed when the rules are not followed, and with a full playing board. We proposed different strategies for the gameplay and different decisions for rules 10 and 11, and evaluated the effects of these strategies and decisions combination on the expected time it takes to win the game with a full playing board. Results showed that strategies and rules decisions combination have significant effects on the expected length of the game, and it is imperative for two players to follow the rules of the sequence dice game as not adhering to the rules can lead to deadlock. Additionally, we found that, when the two players used 20 chips each, the expected length of the sequence dice game was between 32 - 37 rolls, while for unlimited number of chips, the expected length of the sequence dice game was between 41 - 47 rolls.
